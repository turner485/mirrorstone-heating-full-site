                <h3>Warranty Policy</h3>

                <p>Mirrorstone Heating provides a 5-year warranty on all Infrared Heating Panels. This warranty activates from the moment a customer places an order.</p>

                <p>Mirrorstone Infrared Panels that suffer failure within the warranty period should be returned to us for inspection and testing, after which we will either repair or replace the item depending on:<br>
                    - The total usage of the item up to the point of return;<br>
                    - The condition of the panel upon arrival at our place of business.</p>

                <p id="returns-id">Should a panel(s) suffer damage in transit, Mirrorstone Heating is not liable for any damages, nor obliged to replace any damaged panel(s). This responsibility falls on the sender and the courier to ensure that the panel(s) are returned to us in an acceptable condition.</p>

                <p>Mirrorstone Heating strongly recommends emailing images of the item prior to its sending.</p>

                <p>Our warranty policy covers you against any failures that occur while the panels are being used in the manner for which they’re intended. Any misuse, modification or alteration made to Mirrorstone panels will void their warranty and failures will not be rectified.</p>

                <h3>Returns Policy</h3>

                <p>Should you receive a panel that is dead on arrival, the reseller shall notify Mirrorstone Heating immediately. Should a resolution not be achieved over the phone, Mirrorstone Heating will arrange for a collection the next working day. Any modified, tampered with or altered panels will not be eligible for return, as the warranty will have become void.</p>

                <p>Mirrorstone Heating is not obliged in any way to refund orders outside of the 14 day returns and exchanges deadline. Mirrorstone Heating does not accept any liability for failures or delays arising either partially or wholly due to an Act of God, Fire, Explosion, Riot, Civil Commotion, Restriction by Government or other competent authorities, Strikes, Lock Outs, Failures in supplies or any other cause outside of its control.</p>

                <p>Mirrorstone Heating offers the fastest custom IR panel printing service in the UK, with a lead time of just 7 days. The process for customers to order custom image panels is simple.</p>

                <p>1 – The customer places an order for a custom image IR panel.<br>
                    2 – The reseller forwards the order and order number to Mirrorstone Heating.<br>
                    3 – The customer emails the image they would like printed, as well as their order number to images@mirrorstoneheating.co.uk<br>
                    4 – Mirrorstone Heating will check the image to ensure it is of a high enough resolution for print. In the event of any problems, Mirrorstone Heating will contact the customer directly to rectify any issues. If the image is good, Mirrorstone will proceed with the manufacture and printing of the IR panel.<br>
                    5 – Once the panel is complete, Mirrorstone will send it to the reseller.<br>
                    6 – The reseller will then dispatch it to the customer.</p>

                <p>It should be noted that Custom Image IR Panels are not included in our 14 day refunds and exchanges policy due to the custom nature of the item.</p>
