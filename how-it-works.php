                            <p>Infrared panels emit a series of waves from their surface when they’re on.</p>
                            <img src="/images/how-it-works/icon-2.png"/>
                            <p>These waves travel throughout a room at the speed of light until they hit an object (this could be a wall, a piece of furniture, or even you).</p>
                            <img src="/images/how-it-works/icon-3.png"/>
                            <p>At this point, the object absorbs some of the heat energy from the waves, whilst the rest bounce off.</p>
                            <img src="/images/how-it-works/icon-4.png"/>
                            <p>The energy absorbed by the object is radiated back out, whilst the waves continue to bounce around the room until all the energy contained within has been exhausted.</p>
                            <img src="/images/how-it-works/icon-5.png"/>
                            <p>Within a few minutes, every object in the room is warm, and radiates small amounts of heat, turning the entire room into what is known as a “thermal mass” – the panels heat the objects in a room, rather than the air.</p>
                            <img src="/images/how-it-works/icon-6.png"/>
                            <p>The process repeats until the room reaches a comfortable temperature, and the user switches off the heater.</p>
